# Hidden_Digits

Given a random string, this program will calculate its hidden digits.

Hidden digits are calculated as follows:
- Each hidden digit corresponds to a lower case letter, in ascending order: 'a'=0, 'b'=1 ... 'j'=9
- All other letters and symbols are ignored, except for any digits included in the given string
- If no digits (hidden or otherwise) are found, output a relevant message ("NONE")
